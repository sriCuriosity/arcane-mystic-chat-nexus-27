## Project Description

(chatbot) is an advanced conversational AI application designed to provide intelligent, context-aware interactions with users. This project combines a powerful Python backend API with a modern React and TypeScript frontend to deliver a seamless chat experience. The backend handles natural language understanding and intent processing, while the frontend offers a responsive and user-friendly interface.

---

## What the Application Does

- Processes user inputs to understand intent and provide relevant responses.
- Supports real-time chat interactions with dynamic UI updates.
- Integrates advanced intent recognition APIs for accurate conversation flow.
- Provides a scalable architecture separating backend logic and frontend presentation.

---

## Why These Technologies Were Used

- **Python (Backend):** Chosen for its rich ecosystem in AI and natural language processing, ease of building RESTful APIs, and rapid development capabilities.
- **React + TypeScript (Frontend):** Provides a robust, type-safe environment for building interactive user interfaces with reusable components and excellent developer tooling.
- **Vite:** A fast frontend build tool that enhances development experience with instant server start and lightning-fast hot module replacement.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid and consistent styling with utility-first CSS classes, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separates concerns between backend and frontend, improving maintainability and scalability.

## Installation and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- Python (v3.8 or higher recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)

---

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the backend server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The backend API will start running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the project root directory (if not already there):

```bash
cd ..
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

---

### Accessing the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the chatbot interface ready for interaction.

---

## Additional Notes

- For production deployment, consider building the frontend with:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Then serve the static files with a web server or integrate with the backend.

- Tailwind CSS is configured for utility-first styling; customize `tailwind.config.ts` as needed.

- The project uses TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
